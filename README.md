### Now

Living on Earth with my wife and two boys. We love the Smoky Mountains and the Atlantic beaches. Working with a bunch of smart people at [Enok Collective](https://enok.co), where I lead our engineering team. Currently wearing an Augmented Reality visor, and wondering when data will stream to our minds. Passionate about Mars, and intergalactic logistic systems of all kinds.
