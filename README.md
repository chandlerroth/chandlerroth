Hello, Iâ€™m Chandler! I lead engineering at Enok Collective. I am always learning. I love designing and building products that improve the human experience. I write about the human experience, technology, and craftsmanship.

### Now

Living on Earth with my wife and two boys. We love the Smoky Mountains and the Atlantic beaches. Working with a bunch of smart people at Enok Collective, where I lead our engineering team. Currently wearing an Augmented Reality visor, and wondering when data will stream to our minds. Passionate about Mars, and intergalactic logistic systems of all kinds.
